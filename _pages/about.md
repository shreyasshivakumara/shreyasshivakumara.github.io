Hi! Great to see you here.:)

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Science and Technology at Linköping University, Campus Norrköping, under the supervision of Karljohan Lundin Palmerius and the co-supervision of Gabriel Eilertsen. Prior to this, I worked as a research engineer at CMIV, Linköping University, under the guidance of Joel Hedlund and Claes Lundström.

My research lies in the areas of computer graphics, computer vision, and AR/VR. For my doctoral project, I intend to investigate neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), with a particular emphasis on their evaluation and optimization for immersive visualization. My work focuses on bridging the gap between objective image quality metrics and subjective human perception, aiming to establish reliable methods for assessing and improving the visual realism of neural rendering techniques.
